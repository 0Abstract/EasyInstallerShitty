# EasyInstallerSimply

This is just a a simplified version of EasyInstaller. Original one made by Kyiro!
(https://github.com/Kyiro/Fortnite-ManifestsArchive).
Huge shoutout to VastBlast for making the FortniteManifest Archive!
(https://github.com/VastBlast/FortniteManifestArchive).

This is made to prevent the children that are trying to get "old fortnite ðŸ‘¶" but download an iOS or Android Manifest!

## Builds from 16.00+ do NOT work with either Rift or Era. Although Neonite can be used to access Events and builds past 16.00.

Useful Discord servers for Builds that are in the EasyInstaller.exe:

Neo Mods (Used to play events past 16.00): https://discord.gg/n9MAV7HZUk

Era (Used to play Fortnite builds ranging from 2.5 to 12.41 (Subject to change)): https://discord.gg/Erafn

Rift (Used to play Fortnite builds ranging from 1.7.2 - 15.50): https://discord.gg/Riftfn
